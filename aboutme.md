Hi there! Welcome to my site!

My name is Ying Ji. I am a graduate student studying Statistical Genetics at Vanderbilt University <https://medsites.mc.vanderbilt.edu/vgi/mission>. The recent explosion of data from sequening the genome at depth and measuring complex biological systems enables us to accelerate scientific discovery of biology and disease. I work on application and development of statistical and computational approaches to understand the genetic basis of human diseases in a data-driven way. Specifically, my current projects are about prioritizing risk genes and making predictions for disease outcomes. 

I'm creating this blog to synthesis the materials on data, statistics, genetics and general "life lessions" that are of interest to me. 

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, running, trying out exotic restaurants and traveling. I come from Beijing, China. I am currently living in Nashville, TN.
