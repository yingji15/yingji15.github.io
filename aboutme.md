Hi there! Welcome to my site!

My name is Ying Ji. I am currently living in Nashville, TN. I got a B.S. in Biology from Tsinghua University before I came to U.S. I am a graduate student studying *Statistical Genetics* at Vanderbilt University <https://medsites.mc.vanderbilt.edu/vgi/mission>. 

In a broad sense, my research projects are about finding hidden structure and making predictions for disease outcomes from genetics and genomics data through the application and development of statistical and computational approaches. In a narrow sense, I work on using machine learning approaches for risk gene identification and patient outcome predictions. I feel excited to be in an era when technological advances are generating large amounts of genetics and genomics data and we can working towards making sense of them for biological problems. 

I am currently programming, learning new technology and statistics theory on a daily basis. I find it's very easy and natural to forget. But there are  material that I really liked and felt they deserve a proper synthesis for future references. I'm creating this blog to keep track of them. 

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, running and traveling. These activities are important outlet for me outside work and they open me up to the world around me. I really like this quote from Philosopher Bertrand Russell about happiness *"Gradually I learned to be indifferent to myself and my difficulties; I came to center my attention upon external objects: the state of the world, various branches of knowledge, individuals for whom I felt affection."*  I find myself enjoying these objects from time to time.
