Hi there! Welcome to my site!

My name is Ying Ji. I am currently living in Nashville, TN. I got a B.S. in Biology from Tsinghua University before I came to U.S. I am a graduate student studying *Statistical Genetics* at Vanderbilt University <https://medsites.mc.vanderbilt.edu/vgi/mission>. I work on using machine learning approaches for risk gene identification and patient outcome predictions. I feel excited to be in an era when new technological are generating large amounts of biological data and we can working towards making sense of them using statistical and computational approaches.

In my ongoing journey on learning new materials on statistics, programming and other life hacks, I find it very easy and natural to forget. I'm creating this blog to synthesis and keep track of the materials I learn. 

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, running and traveling. These activities make me happy. I really like this quote from Philosopher Bertrand Russell about happiness *"Gradually I learned to be indifferent to myself and my difficulties; I came to center my attention upon external objects: the state of the world, various branches of knowledge, individuals for whom I felt affection."*
