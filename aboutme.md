Hi there! Welcome to my site!

My name is Ying Ji. I am currently living in Nashville, TN. I come from Beijing, China. I got a B.S. in Biological Sciences from Tsinghua University in 2015. Then I became a graduate student studying *Statistical Genetics* at Vanderbilt University <https://medsites.mc.vanderbilt.edu/vgi/mission>. I work on using machine learning approaches for risk gene identification and patient outcome predictions. I feel excited to be in the era when new technological are generating large amounts of biological data and we can working towards making sense of them using statistical and computational approaches.

Recently, I find although we are learning new materials on statistics, programming and other life hacks all the time, it's very easy to forget. I'm creating this blog to synthesis and keep track of the materials I learn. 

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, running and traveling. I also like trying out new activites (e.g. dancing, learning new language, wall climbing) from time to time. These activities help me relax and make new friends.
