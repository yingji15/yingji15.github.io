Hi there! Welcome to my site!

My name is Ying Ji. I come from Beijing, China. I am currently living in Nashville, TN. I am a graduate student studying Statistical Genetics at Vanderbilt University <https://medsites.mc.vanderbilt.edu/vgi/mission>. I work on application and development of statistical and computational approaches to understand genetic basis of human diseases. I feel excited to be in an era when we can solve biological 'puzzles' in a data-driven way.

There's no doubt we need to educate ourselves all the time. One problem I ran into is that it's very easy to lose the "hard to get" knowledge we learned. I'm creating this blog to synthesis and keep track of the materials on data processing, statistics and general "life lessions" that are of interest to me. 

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, running and traveling. I also like trying out new activites (e.g. dancing, learning new language, go to exotic restaurants) from time to time. These activities help me relax and connect with old and new friends.
