Hi there, this is my first post. Currently, I am a 4th year graduate student. Maybe I should know how to be a graduate student very well by now. But the truth is that I am still constantly facing new situations that I am not sure what to do. I want to write about my recent thoughts and resource I found very helpful on *potentially* better accomplishing research tasks and self-management in graduate school. 

For example, I have 3 tasks at hand: writing the first paper, starting a new project and learn a new technique for an ongoing project.  All of them are new to me and make me struggle in some ways. I imagine this is the common situation for many graduate students. The isolation and loneliness is also probably also famililar to all research students. The question is how should I learn to accomplish these new tasks? My advisor is supportive and gives good advice on directions but his job is not figuring out the details on my tasks. Also, I realize that I am probably less competent than he was as a Ph.D. student. So he might not understand some of my struggles since he never ran into it. Thus, I want to find some tutorials that walk me through on how these type of tasks (e.g. write a 1st paper) usually get done. As everything is becoming open source today, I thought I could use some advice from advisors online, let the community educate me.

I've read through a lot of online posts. Most of them are either too generic or too specific for me. Lucily, here are a few posts I found really helpful to my case, and likely applicable to many fields.

# time management

I have done all the coursework now. So I have long hours sitting in front of my desk trying to solve some problem I don't really know how to solve. That's the way it supposed to be. But it is also very new to me. How can I spend my time to make progress? This posts shows me how to make a 'task schedule' of my own.

# how to write paper?

I am working on writing a research paper these days for the first time. I have no idea what the process should be like. This link is very helpful.

# how to work with advisor?

Communication is not my strength, I am still learning:

# how to stay positive when you wonder whether your work matters? 

This is a very important one for me. 
I get stuck a lot lately on my projects and I wonder:

Am I just not good enough for this project? 

If someone may finish the same task faster and better than me, what's the point of me holding this project back? That someone doesn't need to be a famous scientist, could just be a labmate sitting next to me. Why is my advisor still letting me do this? More importantly, what do I contribute? What's the value of me being here? 

These questions puzzle me a lot these days. 

I searched quite a bit. It seems one way is to think about this as training for a sport: you may not be the best athelete, but you becoming better at it. I find I can live with it. Here is a good post on it:

Another piece I found helpful is probably cliche, but it's very moving and touching. It's from *the Myth of Sisyphus* by Albert Camus. 

"I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain. One always finds one’s burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself, forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy."


If you are in graduate school as well, may the forth be with you and hope we can all make it a fulfilling experience!
