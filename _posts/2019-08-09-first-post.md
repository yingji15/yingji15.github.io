This is my first post. It's not technical. It's about my lately thoughts on how to be better as a graduate student.

Currently, I have 3 things at hand and all of them make me struggle from time to time. My advisor is supportive but he has limited time. As everything is becoming open source today, I thought I could use some advice from other advisors online.

Here are a few posts I found really helpful.

# time management

I have done all the coursework now. So I have long hours sitting in front of my desk trying to solve some problem I don't really know how to solve. That's the way it supposed to be. But it is also very new to me. How can I spend my time to make progress? This posts shows me how to make a 'task schedule' of my own.

# how to write paper?

I am working on writing a research paper these days for the first time. I have no idea what the process should be like. This link is very helpful.

# how to work with advisor?

Communication is not my strength, I am still learning:

# how to stay positive when you wonder whether your work matters? 

This is a very important one for me. 
I get stuck a lot lately on my projects and I wonder:

Am I just not good enough for this project? 

If someone may finish the same task faster and better than me, what's the point of me dragging this problem behind? That someone doesn't need to be a famous scientist, could just be a labmate sitting next to me. Why is my advisor still letting me do this? More importantly, what do I contribute? What's the value of me being here? 

These questions puzzle me a lot these days. 

I searched quite a bit. It seems one way is to think about this as training for a sport: you may not be the best athelete, but you becoming better at it as you suffer through the training. Here is a good post on it:

Another piece I found helpful is probably cliche, but it's very moving and touching. It's from the Myth of Sisyphus by Albert Camus. 

"I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain. One always finds one’s burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself, forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy."


If you are in graduate school as well, hope we can all make it a fulfilling experience!
