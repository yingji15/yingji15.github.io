title: How to merge many files into a big dataframe in R?

At work, sometimes we need to analysis lots of output together. 
For example, this could be summary output from many different conditions/ simulation parameters. 
Each output file is a table of similar format (e.g. 1st column is a gene id, 2nd column is score using tool 1, 3rd column is score using tool 2).
We may want to combine them into a big dataframe, in this way, it's easier to use visualization tools to help us identify patterns of the data.
In that process, we also need to rename the files, because they are all of same name now. 
Here are some simple scripts to do this task, adapted from <https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2008-April/159060.html> and <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16666643/merging-more-than-2-dataframes-in-r-by-rownames>!

```
#get the file names of df need to merge

mypath<- getwd()
filenames=list.files(path=mypath, full.names=TRUE)


#read in all data 
allData <- lapply(filenames, function(x){
    dat<-read.table(file=x, header=T)
   
	a<- unlist(strsplit( x,"/")) # this name is long with path info, we just want to use the last part of it 
	
	names(dat)<-paste( a[length(a)], colnames(dat),sep="_") # rename columns

	dat    # return the dataframe
	})


#merge all of them
MyMerge       <- function(x, y){
  df            <- merge(x, y, by= "row.names", all.x= F, all.y= F) #merge them 
  rownames(df)  <- df$Row.names
  df$Row.names  <- NULL
  return(df)
}


# save output

out<- Reduce(MyMerge,allData) # do this to all elements of allData

```

Then we got the data frame we want!
